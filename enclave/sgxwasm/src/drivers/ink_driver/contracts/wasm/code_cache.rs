//! A module that implements instrumented code cache.
//!
//! - In order to run contract code we need to instrument it with gas metering.
//! To do that we need to provide the schedule which will supply exact gas costs values.
//! We cache this code in the storage saving the schedule version.
//! - Before running contract code we check if the cached code has the schedule version that
//! is equal to the current saved schedule.
//! If it is equal then run the code, if it isn't reinstrument with the current schedule.
//! - When we update the schedule we want it to have strictly greater version than the current saved one:
//! this guarantees that every instrumented contract code in cache cannot have the version equal to the current one.
//! Thus, before executing a contract it should be reinstrument with new schedule.
